name     : Build and Gapfill an FBA Model
subtitle : |
    Starting with an Annotated Genome, build a metabolic model and add reactions until the model can predict growth.
tooltip  : |
    In this App, you can build a model for a genome and gapfill it.

    <p>Starting with an annotated Genome, this KBase App will use the annotations to identify
    which biochemical reactions are likely to occur in your organism.  Annotations are not always perfect,
    so some essential reactions will likely be missed.  Gapfilling is an approach to automatically
    add reactions until the model is complete enough to predict that the cell will grow under some conditions</p>
    
    <p>Begin by selecting an annotated Genome data object below, and provide a name for the new metabolic model.
    Then click Run to start the App</p>
    
    <p>For more technical details about the methods used in this app, see the documentation on the 
    <a href="https://kbase.us/developer-zone/documentation/fba-modeling-service/" target="_blank">kbase FBA tools</a>.</p>
