name     : Annotate Domains in a Genome
subtitle : |
    Annotate protein domains in a Genome object.  The Genome must already have annotated genes.  The annotation job may run for an hour or longer.  When the annotation job finishes, a Domains object will be stored in your workspace. [4]

    Annotate protein domains in a Genome object.  The Genome must already have annotated genes.  The annotation job may run for an hour or longer.  When the annotation job finishes, a Domains object will be stored in your workspace. This method will find domains from the following domain databases: Pfam, TIGRFAMs, COG, SMART, and NCBI CDD [4]
