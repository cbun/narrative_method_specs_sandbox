description : |
    A draft metabolic model serves as an advanced starting point for a model curation. Models are built upon genome functional annotations where gene-protein associations are mapped onto biochemical reactions. The model can be used for Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) on a given media. Once a draft model is generated, the quality of the model could be improved by filling gaps in the metabolic network (gapfilling process) and by manual curation efforts. Gapfilling process involves of adding reactions and compounds to make biochemical network generate biomass. This "gapfilled"  version of the model could be further improved by reconciling phenotypic experimental growth data generated on different media conditions.

    Given an annotated Genome, build a draft metabolic model which can be analyzed with FBA.
