name     : Gapfill a Metabolic Model
subtitle : |
    Run Gapfilling on an metabolic model.  Gapfill attempts to identify the minimal number of reactions needed to add to your metabolic model in order for the model to predict growth in the given media condition (or in complete media if no Media is provided).  Gapfilling is an optimization procedure that can produce many possible solutions.  After a gapfilling job is submitted and run, you can view the results by viewing a metabolic model details, and incorporate the new reactions by running the Integrate Gapfill Solution function.
